Driverless cars can help effect safety,traffic, and the polution in the air. Driverless cars could help communities and the economy in many ways.\\n\\nDriverless cars could change the way people commute. As driverless cars begin to come in play, less people will have to drive their own car. As many people know, tons people get into accidents everyday because of the people behind the wheel making harmful decisions, if driverless cars were put out on the roads there would be less traffic accidents because there would not be people behind the wheel who are reckless and causing these accidents to occur. Driverless cars alert the drive when needed or when about to come into contact with something therfore these cars will help reduce the effects of human error and give more reaction time to the human in the passenger side.\\n\\nThis could also shorten the amount of people taking the bus to the places they need to go, which would make the polution problem a way less common thing. Also, lots of people with disablities can not drive, with the help of a driverless car those people could get to the places they need to go instead of someone else driving them or them not being able to go at all.\\n\\nDriverless cars would also just provide convience to the world. Lots of people dread the drive to work everyday or a long drive to Disney, but with driverless cars they would not have to drive there. They could sit and relax and not have to worry about making a traffic accident because of them being tired behind the wheel.\\n\\nThe factories making these cars would need more help. Thus, bringing in more jobs for the people and making the economy stronger. This could also bring in money by the people who want these cars because of the convience of them. Driverless cars could lead to more advancements in technology to help driving become safer which would bring in more money for the economy. The invention of the driverless car could be something that impacts the society and world in a new and modern way\\n\\nDriverless cars could impact our society in many ways and boost the economy. These cars could change someones life between life and death. There would be less accidents making the health and living rate higher. People with disablties would now be able to drive and live their lifes freely like should always of been. Finally, it will not only help the lifes of humans but it will help the Earth by giving off less polution and by people traveling in less polution dense vehicles which would better the world.             \",\n          \"I think what they are trying to say is that because of the face on Mars.

It has been 15 years since they have looked at the face, so the thing may not be there still. They still have to remeber that just because they think it was made by aliens doesn't mean it was I mean there is no such thing as aliens so we dont need to thing of it as that.\\n\\nThey have took over 3 journeys to see the land from the sky they need to go to, the land and see if there is anybody on the land. They need to have a robot with a camria that is kinda like and apple product that can face time them and then it could go to land and walk around not only that but people could see if there is any creature living on the plant.

However, this nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. \\nOften referred to as Earth's \\u201ctwin,\\u201d Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner - in space terms - humans have spent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down of Venus in more than three decades. Numberous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us. \\nA thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high presure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. \\nIf our sister is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus beccause it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?\\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\\nHowever, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovattions that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. \\nNASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simuulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have laster for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role int he 1940s during World War II. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern commputers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made mroe resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. \\nStriving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\",\n          \"Copyright Restricted\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_text_2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Paris bans\\ndriving due to smog\\nby Robert Duffer\\nAfter days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the\\nglobal city.\\nOn Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31).

Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They\\u2019re not alone;\\naccording to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore\\u2014thanks to the quirks of the\\nelectoral college\\u2014won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would\\nprefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close\\nelection in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral\\ncollege still has its defenders. What gives? . . .\\nWhat\\u2019s wrong with the electoral college\\nUnder the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of\\nelectors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote\\nfor [John] Kerry, you\\u2019d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off\\u0002chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry\\nwould get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office.\\nWho picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions,\\nsometimes the state party\\u2019s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates\\nthemselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes\\nget confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\\nThe single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster\\nfactor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the\\nbiggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state\\nlegislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always\\ndefy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly\\nsucceeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F.\\nKennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the\\nsame vein, \\u201cfaithless\\u201d electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\u2019s candidate and\\ncast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of\\nelectors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who\\nwas presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent\\u2019s electors, but he made sure to do so\\n\\u201cwithout establishing a precedent.\\u201d What if it happened again?\\nPerhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the\\nelection would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the\\npresident. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote,\\nthe single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say\\nas the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many\\nvoters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House\\u2019s selection can hardly be\\nexpected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In\\n1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have\\noccurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The\\nelection is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.\\nAt the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take\\u0002all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of\\nwinning, focusing only on the tight races in the \\u201cswing\\u201d states. During the 2000 campaign,\\nseventeen states didn\\u2019t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and\\nvoters in 25 of the largest media markets didn\\u2019t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a\\ngood argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio,\\nthey have yet to make it. . . .\\nIt\\u2019s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in\\nfavor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct\\nelections are spurious at best.

Posner\\nThe Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of\\nselecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the\\nmost popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the\\nElectoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the\\npresident, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you\\u2019re actually voting for a\\nslate of electors.\\nBut each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\u2019s nominee (and that\\ntrust is rarely betrayed) . . . [; however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral\\nvote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in\\n2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the\\nfirst time since 1888.\\nThere are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic\\npedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.\\n1) Certainty of Outcome\\nA dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible\\u2014it happened in 2000\\n\\u2014but it\\u2019s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning\\ncandidate\\u2019s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In\\n[2012\\u2019s] election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to\\nonly 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. . . . Because almost all states\\naward electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a\\nlandslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible\\nbecause the total number of votes\\u2014538\\u2014is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .\\n2) Everyone\\u2019s President\\nThe Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No\\nregion (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional\\nfavorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states,\\nfor he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This\\nis a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful\\npresident. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised\\u2014to feel that their\\nvotes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really\\nisn\\u2019t their president.\\n3) Swing States\\nThe winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates\\u2014as we saw\\nin [2012\\u2019s] election\\u2014to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up\\nstates are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign\\u2014to really listen to the competing\\ncandidates\\u2014knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most\\nthoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most\\ninformation and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the\\nones to decide the election.\\n4) Big States\\nThe Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states\\n(by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the\\nConstitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who\\nwon that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the\\nwinner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from\\npresidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .\\n5) Avoid Run-Off Elections\\nThe Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a\\nmajority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43\\npercent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and\\n370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins\\na majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential\\nelection process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .\\nIt can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off\\npotential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state\\u2014Democrats in Texas, for\\nexample, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less\\nincentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by\\npopular vote . . . . But of course no voter\\u2019s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that,\\nabout one-half the eligible American population did vote in [2012\\u2019s] election. Voters in\\npresidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people\\nwho think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .\\nanachronism: a person or a thing that seems to\\nbelong to the past and not to fit in the present\\npedigree: the origin and history of something,\\nespecially when it is good or impressive\\nliberal or conservative: political philosophies\\ncommonly seen as opposite each other\\nObama: Barack Obama, 44th president of the\\nUnited States\\nRomney: Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for\\nPresident in 2012\\nplurality: when a candidate receives more votes\\nthan other candidates while not receiving a clear\\nmajority of votes\\nExcerpt from \\u201cIn Defense of the Electoral College:\\nFive reasons to keep our despised method of\\nchoosing the President\\u201d from Slate Magazine by\\nJudge Richard A.

When adjusted for population\\ngrowth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily\\nthereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment\\nresearch company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent\\nbelow the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation\\ncertainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and\\nthe unemployed weren\\u2019t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving\\npreceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next\\nfew years will be telling.\\n\\u201cWhat most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person\\nstarted to come down two to three years before the downturn,\\u201d said Michael Sivak, who studies\\nthe trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan\\u2019s Transportation Research\\nInstitute. \\u201cI think that means something more fundamental is going on.\\u201d\\nIf the pattern persists\\u2014and many sociologists believe it will\\u2014it will have beneficial\\nimplications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest\\nsource of America\\u2019s emissions, just behind power plants.

She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible\\nand allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center\\ncities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the\\nrise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements,\\nincluding the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.\\nWith all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may\\nfind less reason to resume the habit. . . .\\nNew York\\u2019s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect\\nthose new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.\\nDemographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There\\nhas been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older\\npeople are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak\\u2019s research has found.\\nHe and I have similar observations about our children.

If he tried to use my evidence against me i would show him the picture and let him take a good look and tell him what it actually is and that its not alien related. After he wants to know how i discoverd that it wasnt real i would show him this article and state that this article it 100% acuarate and alien life isnt on that planet other wise the Viking 1 would have seen it when circleing it and scouting it. When i have completed my statement i would give him the cordanites to the planet so he can look at it from a satillite. When i tell him that the pictures taken in 1976 and 1998 were taken when there was bad weather on the planet he will understand why it looks identical to a human face and that alien life did not create this and he will agree and simply pass on the evidence of my statement to others who think that its a alien created object. \n",

            " It has come to my attention that there is a concern with conspiracy theorists about the Face on Mars. It has been said by these theorists that the Face on Mars is in fact, an alien monument. Clearly, the Face on Mars is no such thing, it is simply a landform. There is evicence from NASA supporting this statement, along with the landmark containg nothing else, and that there is no absolute proof that aliens even exist.\n",
            "\n",
            "Initially, when the first photo of the Face was taken by a Mars Global surveyor named Viking 1 in 1976, scientists were shocked and the public got excited about the idea of aliens on Mars. The passage claims,\"Scientists figured it was just another Marian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" This illustrates how the Face was at first mistaken as a landmark left by extraterrestrials, but was shortly discovered later as a mesa. Opponents might claim that NASA is hiding information supporting the statements of aliens making the Face. This is a red herring. If anything, NASA would benefit from the findings of evidence of lifeforms on Mars. It is also important to know that Jim Garver, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated,\"We felt this was important to taxpayers...-We photgraphed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" This shows how eager he was to show it to the public.\n",

            "\n",

According the text,\"'As a rule fo thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,' he added.'So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'\" This proves how there is no\n",

They may counterclaim that because water was discovered on Mars, then there must be life, and they could be correct. However, there is no substantial evidence that could support the statement that it is certain that there are aliens that even exist.\n",

            " It is equivalent to a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west. Garvin says that its just the shading of the area that makes it look like a face. Over the years the face changes it starts to change shape or crust over and because of that it makes it look like a natural landform. NASA wouldn't have sent it out if they really thought is was alien. Some people think that the face is a bona fide for evidence that there is life on mars, but NASA would hide that information. they only sent the image out to get more peoples attention towards mars. They most likely sent out on the web to stir up peoples thoughts and to make them nervous about if there really is life on mars.\n",

            " Imagine you are a scientist at NASA sicussing the face withsomeone who thinks it was created by alliens. Well we all know that alliens are not real it has been provin many time by other scients. I would unerstand why people would think it was created by these myth cretures, but u also got to think about how land andother things can form tier self in to living fetures like for some exsample. On an sunny day you look outside and u see some clouds and you stare at it for a while. Than all the sudden u see faceses and animals that you reconginize. Like one day I saw a little dolphine in the sky and I got the thinking theirs no wasy their could be a dolphine in the sky. So thats like me saying that thiers a man shaped face on mars tat could have been civilisation on the planet of mars, but dont think wrong i believe that its possabel for people on earth to actual live on that, because theirs other scientists that has proven that to most people and their starting to recrute peopole to actual go to mars. Also their for in the passage it saids it was a huge rock formation like come on now we know a real life humae face is not as huge for it to be spotted from face. Also on mars their is a lot of diffrent shape and sizes and holes like in the moon so its just do univers doing what it does best to form diffrent imagies and diffrent shapes like the was it formed earth and broke diffrent things apart and also land. If u also look in the passage at paragraph 12 it saids in the first sentence that. What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa----LANDFORMS common around the american west. to also make people intrested in the artical the put a. Huge rock formation from mars so theri for their also saying it was made from these mythical cretures called. Alliens and why would alliens want to make a human face in the first pllace if you think about it it actually make sense. For them just to attract people to a new land form that they have found that has a more like humans fetures. So thats why i say that alliens did not make that image or a landform human like image on mars. So thats what i was a scientist at NSAS discussing the face with someone who thinks it was alliens that formed a human like imagie on mars.\n",

There has been pictures taken of the landforms from 1976,1998 and 2001, and yes they kind of look like faces but they are landforms. NASA defends what people are saying about the faces on Mars. Yes, peple think that there is life on Mars,but how would the faces on Mars prove that? The guy then says yeah I understand were your coming from. The guy then says yes, I guess your right about them being landform. It really didn't take much convincing. Before the guy left he said Thanks. After doing all that I went ahead and did more research just so if I found more about the landforms, then I could call the guy and let him know what's going on.            \n",

            " I understand you think that the Face on mars was created by aliens or some other trype of unknown creature, but today im going to be proving to you that your theories and or accusations are all false. Here are some things to help you see the light of the situation.\n",

            "First and foremost, NASA wouldn't just release the image of the Face on Mars to the whole world if we weren't sure their was some investigating to do regarding how the landform actually was formed. Not only that but if we weren't 100% sure if the landform was safe towards the lives of our fellow people then we would try to figure out whats going on until we actually tell the public what were really facing up against here, and that's even if we need to release the issue to the world it might be a very minor problem that can be fixed and or destroyed with our amazing team.\n",

In certain ways it even shows offense toward NASA by questioning our research.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, if this Face was created by another type of life that we may not know about then we most likely would've known about it by now. Quite frankly I think it's best if we don't ever come face-to-face with those different types of unknown life considering they may be way more advanced than our civilization with more advanced technology and many other things that mankind isn't ready for yet. They may end up being the enemy instead of the friend and that could very much jepordize mankind.\n",

A person named Xavier Smith believes the face on planet mars was created by aliens. I told him the face is just a natural form land. The reason it is a natural land form is because there are lots of strange things that happen like that on different planets. Some scientist believe the face was an alien artifact. It could have just formed there. In my opinion i don't believe aliens are real. I believe that the humans are the only race. If aliens were real they would have probly tooken over planet earth right now. There are a lot of people who think aliens are real. People think they fly around in invisible ufo's and have really advanced technology.

Therefore I argue that its just a natural landform and not in any form made by an alien.\n",

Aliens are not real, if they were it'd be everywhere all over the news. People would be so excited and although going to space is a risk many people would do it.

The cheif scientist of NASA Jim said that \"We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" that gives us proof that when the (MGS) took a shot of this face it looked like it was a natural landform on Cydonia.\n",

            "I have a strong belief that the \"Face on Mars\" was a natural landform. I do not think that the face was created by aliens. It could be a possibility but there is no proof that would back up that statement. Although, the fact that that the face was a natural landform doesn't need much backup because it's something that naturally happens. The only difference is that it's not usually a face that is usually created.\n",

            "How could aliens know what to make a face look like? And not just any face, a human face. As the caption noted, \"a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" I doubt that the aliens could make an exact replica of a human face because they have nothing to reference it off of.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, theres another question. How the face could have been made by aliens? What could the aliens possibly have made the face with? Im sure they would have required some tools to make this face on the planet of mars. Their hands would not be likely to complete that task because of what the planet is made of. The NASA didnt say they found any tools or objects that could be used as to make this \"face\".\n",

In the passage it said \"Manwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" This implies that there is no civilization on Mars. So if there is no civilization on Mars, there is no one or nothing that could have made this face. How would they have made it if there is no one there to possibly make it?\n",

            "There is reasoning I have to back up my opnion that it was a natural landform. Natural landforms happen here and there, almost everywhere. They come in any shapes and sizes. The form of a landform could be in any kind of shape. It's whatever it comes out to be. In this specific case though, the landform has captured the form of a face, somehow, with the correct facial features in the right places.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the passage the \"Face of Mars\" is compared to the \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" If there are other more specificly shaped landforms in the world, why cant it be one on mars? Theres no difference in the form that natural landforms come in. They all can come in any type of way. It doesn't make a difference where they're at or what they're made of. A natural landform is always going to be a natural landform.\n",

            " Twenty five years ago a NASA Viking 1 aircraft was circling around Mars to find somewhere to land for its sister ship Viking 2. The aircraft was taking pictures and it captured something very unusual. It was a human face,it was enormous. It's head was two miles from each end to end. Once the word got out and NASA unveiled a picture it gave Mars lots of attention. Since it was on Mars lots of people thought that it was made by an alien. They is unbelieveable how can aliens make a human face. Aliens aren't even real so how can they make it. Plus, If they were real how would they be able to make a human face if they never seen one. I agree with the JPL website that it is indeed a natural landform. According to the passage it says that \" The image first appeared on a JPL website, revealling.... a natural landform\". There was no alien monument after all. Garvin says that \" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars\". I know that the face on mars was just a natual lanform. I know this because there is no such thing as aliens and there isn't any evidence to completely prove this. Plus I believe if there was alien they want no how humans look or theirselves for that matter. Scientist say that it is indeed a landform. I mean just think about it have u ever ate some potato chips and seen a chip that resembled something or someone. Would you sit there and think an alien did that or is it just natural , the way it is. I strongly believe that The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.\n",

However i think that this is just an must understandment of photos. NASA has to research and discover such a thing or land format i strongly believe that this is just the land formation the way the rock is shaped and structured. In the passege is says that landforms are common around the american west so the landfromation NASA said that they aliens made was actually land formations because were there most common its going to happen often.In paragraph 7 it states \"There was no alien mounment after all.\". In my Conclusion i'll present to you that after all the alien monument was actually land formations because there most commen in the west. It could be some alien's work but not quite yet is there time. The land formations can create some of the most beautiful work. I Strongly agree with NASA that there were no alien monument at all because why would an alien come to mars to build a giant face like sculpture just to get attiton on mars. Kinda funny right ?

            " No, that is not a face in the picture from the Viking 1 from 1976,rather, like the scientists at NASA say, it is a natural landform.Yes, I know it looks like a face but in reality,\n",

            "it's not.Technically, you really can't say it is from an alien life form because scientists and astronauts haven't found evidence of life on Mars yet.Conspiracy theorists say NASA is trying to hide the truth from us when actually they want you to know the truth.Otherwise, if they didn't want you to know the truth they wouldn't have put the picture out in the first place.There are a lot of statistics and facts that obviously point to the truth and I'm going to explain all of them to you.First,the other and newer pictures, the obvius comparison to landforms on Earth, and why your brain thinks it sees a face.\n",
            "\n",
            "First of all, it's obvoiusly not a face because the newer pictures ,that were taken of the same thing show a different thing.You might wonder, how can it show a different thing but still be the same thing?Well, the newest picture,from 2001, was taken with a much better camera.So, the picture is clearer and so is the fact that this is a natural landform.Finally, the pictures are the most important clue that the face is a natural landform.That is how the pictures tell that the face is a landform.\n",
            "\n",
            "Secondly, if you compare landforms on Earth to the face pictures you'll get similar pictures.For example, if you take a picture of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho from above and compare it to the 2001 picture they'll look identical.That is according to cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.He stated that, the face reminds him the most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.Finally, when and if you get the chance you should compare the face to other landforms on Earth.That is how comparing landforms on Earth,to the face can provide evidence to you that the face is a natural landform.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, your brain somewhat tricks you into seeing a face,but don't worry because it's natural.When you look at the first picture, you're most likely going to see a face, even I see a face.So, we kind of get excited about discovering another life form, and we start to jump to conclusions.Don't think there is something wrong with that because there is not, as long as you have evidence to support it,but in this case,you don't.Furthermore, the reason are brain 'tricks' us into seeing a face is in our DNA.For example,from when you were born everytime you looked in the mirror or looked at somebody else, you saw a face.The reason why you always see a face is because our brain has been ''hard-wired'' to recognize a face.That is how our brains trick us into seeing a face.\n",
            "\n",
            "To conclude, those are all the clues/reasons why your brain sees and thinks the first picture is a face when it's actually a natural landform called a mesa.To recap, the comparison of the first picture to the 2001 picture can show that it's a mesa. Next, the comparison of landforms on Earth to the face can show you it's a mesa.Those are clues that can prove to you that the face is a mesa. So basically, all you have to do is compare different things to the face.Finally, the reason why your brain tricks you into seeing a face instead of a mesa is because everybody's brain has been 'hard-wired' to recognize a face.So that is why when you look at the first picture you see a face instead of what it really is, a mesa.Finally, sometimes all you have to do to find the truth is dig and look deeper and you'll discover the truth.That is why I say the face in the first picture is actually, indeed a mesa.\n",

We had one of our spacecrafts (Viking 1) circling mars, and taking pictures of possible landing sites for another one of our spacecrafts (Viking 2). Later on, we found that Viking 1 had snapped a picture of what seemed to look like a human face. We were very excited to find out what this new finding was, but we later found out that it was just a Martian mesa. Very common around Cydonia.

Like I was saying, I was in a coffe shop nearby where I worked, and was suddenly approached by a young man in his twenties. He stood there for a while making sure that I acknowledged him.

Even when I said this, he disregarded it, and continued speaking about how he thought that this picture of \"the Mesa\" was proof of extraterestrial life on mars. as soon as he said this I burst out with laughter. Tears were falling from my eyes, as I thought this was a joke. but, when i saw that he was serious, I immediatley stopped laughing, and apologized. i explained to him that the picture of what he thought was a face, really was just \"the Martian equilavent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west\".

            " I do not agree that the face on Mars was made by aliens for a couple of reasons. The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars Only samples that they can never find to be true. Another reason for my disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane. I also disagree because in paragragh seven when they flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5,1998 they said that there was no alien monument after all. From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues. The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a \"messa brutte\" which is a landform so that gives the answer right there.

            "Initially, when the first photo of the Face was taken by a Mars Global surveyor named Viking 1 in 1976, scientists were shocked and the public got excited about the idea of aliens on Mars. The passage claims,\"Scientists figured it was just another Marian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" This illustrates how the Face was at first mistaken as a landmark left by extraterrestrials, but was shortly discovered later as a mesa. Opponents might claim that NASA is hiding information supporting the statements of aliens making the Face. This is a red herring. If anything, NASA would benefit from the findings of evidence of lifeforms on Mars. It is also important to know that Jim Garver, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated,\"We felt this was important to taxpayers...-We photgraphed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" This shows how eager he was to show it to the public.\n",

Well we all know that alliens are not real it has been provin many time by other scients. I would unerstand why people would think it was created by these myth cretures, but u also got to think about how land andother things can form tier self in to living fetures like for some exsample. On an sunny day you look outside and u see some clouds and you stare at it for a while. Than all the sudden u see faceses and animals that you reconginize. Like one day I saw a little dolphine in the sky and I got the thinking theirs no wasy their could be a dolphine in the sky. So thats like me saying that thiers a man shaped face on mars tat could have been civilisation on the planet of mars, but dont think wrong i believe that its possabel for people on earth to actual live on that, because theirs other scientists that has proven that to most people and their starting to recrute peopole to actual go to mars. Also their for in the passage it saids it was a huge rock formation like come on now we know a real life humae face is not as huge for it to be spotted from face. Also on mars their is a lot of diffrent shape and sizes and holes like in the moon so its just do univers doing what it does best to form diffrent imagies and diffrent shapes like the was it formed earth and broke diffrent things apart and also land. If u also look in the passage at paragraph 12 it saids in the first sentence that. What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa----LANDFORMS common around the american west. to also make people intrested in the artical the put a. Huge rock formation from mars so theri for their also saying it was made from these mythical cretures called. Alliens and why would alliens want to make a human face in the first pllace if you think about it it actually make sense. For them just to attract people to a new land form that they have found that has a more like humans fetures. So thats why i say that alliens did not make that image or a landform human like image on mars. So thats what i was a scientist at NSAS discussing the face with someone who thinks it was alliens that formed a human like imagie on mars.\n",

A person named Xavier Smith believes the face on planet mars was created by aliens. I told him the face is just a natural form land. The reason it is a natural land form is because there are lots of strange things that happen like that on different planets. Some scientist believe the face was an alien artifact. It could have just formed there. In my opinion i don't believe aliens are real. I believe that the humans are the only race. If aliens were real they would have probly tooken over planet earth right now. There are a lot of people who think aliens are real.

After reading the promt and looking at the pictures it is just a mound of dirt with some divites in it. As you can probably tell looking at the picture from 2001 to the newest picture, the photograph from 01 just looks like a mound of dirt with some holes in it, but the new picture has been badly photoshopped into looking like someone has just died and their face remains uncovered by dirt.

After that comment this person had me thinking, I didn't believe what he said was true. After I considered it I had a long talk with this young man, here were my arguments. If there were aliens and they put the face there, dont you think they would've came to earth already, Mars atmosphere is too strong for an so called alien or human to be on there, and also the face just could be a natural landform made from weather changes. In the next few paragraphs I will explain my points.\n",

The cheif scientist of NASA Jim said that \"We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" that gives us proof that when the (MGS) took a shot of this face it looked like it was a natural landform on Cydonia.\n",

            "Finally, to conclude that I believe that this is a natural landform and not created by aliens is that if you play real close attention to the photographs this resembles natural causes and not supernatural causes from anything. Also it can be described as a natural landform is how the features are and how it looks natural and how it looks like a rock and not an aircraft or anything made by aliens or to be described as an alien monument or artifact.   \n",

            " Twenty five years ago a NASA Viking 1 aircraft was circling around Mars to find somewhere to land for its sister ship Viking 2. The aircraft was taking pictures and it captured something very unusual. It was a human face,it was enormous. It's head was two miles from each end to end. Once the word got out and NASA unveiled a picture it gave Mars lots of attention. Since it was on Mars lots of people thought that it was made by an alien. They is unbelieveable how can aliens make a human face. Aliens aren't even real so how can they make it. Plus, If they were real how would they be able to make a human face if they never seen one. I agree with the JPL website that it is indeed a natural landform. According to the passage it says that \" The image first appeared on a JPL website, revealling.... a natural landform\". There was no alien monument after all. Garvin says that \" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars\". I know that the face on mars was just a natual lanform. I know this because there is no such thing as aliens and there isn't any evidence to completely prove this. Plus I believe if there was alien they want no how humans look or theirselves for that matter. Scientist say that it is indeed a landform. I mean just think about it have u ever ate some potato chips and seen a chip that resembled something or someone. Would you sit there and think an alien did that or is it just natural , the way it is. I strongly believe that The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.\n",

Well, in my own personal opinion I believe that it is a natural landform because, in 1998 NASA went back to Mars, and took 10 pictures to get the perfet shot. I also believe this because, landforms are common around the American West. Although, some my think the picture is an alien artifact, it is not because NASA went back to Mars with an even better camera and, took even more pictures of the Face.\n",

In the passage it says,\" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origninal Viking photos.\" It also says,\"\n",

            "\n",
            "First of all, it's obvoiusly not a face because the newer pictures ,that were taken of the same thing show a different thing.You might wonder, how can it show a different thing but still be the same thing?Well, the newest picture,from 2001, was taken with a much better camera.So, the picture is clearer and so is the fact that this is a natural landform.Finally, the pictures are the most important clue that the face is a natural landform.That is how the pictures tell that the face is a landform.\n",
            "\n",
            "Secondly, if you compare landforms on Earth to the face pictures you'll get similar pictures.For example, if you take a picture of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho from above and compare it to the 2001 picture they'll look identical.That is according to cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.He stated that, the face reminds him the most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.Finally, when and if you get the chance you should compare the face to other landforms on Earth.That is how comparing landforms on Earth,to the face can provide evidence to you that the face is a natural landform.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, your brain somewhat tricks you into seeing a face,but don't worry because it's natural.When you look at the first picture, you're most likely going to see a face, even I see a face.So, we kind of get excited about discovering another life form, and we start to jump to conclusions.Don't think there is something wrong with that because there is not, as long as you have evidence to support it,but in this case,you don't.Furthermore, the reason are brain 'tricks' us into seeing a face is in our DNA.For example,from when you were born everytime you looked in the mirror or looked at somebody else, you saw a face.The reason why you always see a face is because our brain has been ''hard-wired'' to recognize a face.That is how our brains trick us into seeing a face.\n",

Next, the comparison of landforms on Earth to the face can show you it's a mesa.Those are clues that can prove to you that the face is a mesa. So basically, all you have to do is compare different things to the face.Finally, the reason why your brain tricks you into seeing a face instead of a mesa is because everybody's brain has been 'hard-wired' to recognize a face.So that is why when you look at the first picture you see a face instead of what it really is, a mesa.Finally, sometimes all you have to do to find the truth is dig and look deeper and you'll discover the truth.That is why I say the face in the first picture is actually, indeed a mesa.\n",

            " I do not agree that the face on Mars was made by aliens for a couple of reasons. The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars Only samples that they can never find to be true. Another reason for my disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane. I also disagree because in paragragh seven when they flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5,1998 they said that there was no alien monument after all. From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues. The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a \"messa brutte\" which is a landform so that gives the answer right there. This is why I degree with whoever says that aliens formed the face on Mars.\n",

From information we get from Earths land marks we can saftly say this is a natural land mark the planet has made. The resons why the landform looks like a face is because of shadows. There are no alieans creating human faces on Mars. It is just like nobody is creating Mountains on Earth. The public is just being advertised by movies, books, and magazines to think that there is an alien creating human faces on Mars.

See there are a lot of stuff that can be formed from earth that was formed by God like the Grand Canyon, or Mount Everus.

Well we all know that alliens are not real it has been provin many time by other scients. I would unerstand why people would think it was created by these myth cretures, but u also got to think about how land andother things can form tier self in to living fetures like for some exsample. On an sunny day you look outside and u see some clouds and you stare at it for a while. Than all the sudden u see faceses and animals that you reconginize. Like one day I saw a little dolphine in the sky and I got the thinking theirs no wasy their could be a dolphine in the sky. So thats like me saying that thiers a man shaped face on mars tat could have been civilisation on the planet of mars, but dont think wrong i believe that its possabel for people on earth to actual live on that, because theirs other scientists that has proven that to most people and their starting to recrute peopole to actual go to mars. Also their for in the passage it saids it was a huge rock formation like come on now we know a real life humae face is not as huge for it to be spotted from face. Also on mars their is a lot of diffrent shape and sizes and holes like in the moon so its just do univers doing what it does best to form diffrent imagies and diffrent shapes like the was it formed earth and broke diffrent things apart and also land. If u also look in the passage at paragraph 12 it saids in the first sentence that. What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa----LANDFORMS common around the american west. to also make people intrested in the artical the put a. Huge rock formation from mars so theri for their also saying it was made from these mythical cretures called. Alliens and why would alliens want to make a human face in the first pllace if you think about it it actually make sense. For them just to attract people to a new land form that they have found that has a more like humans fetures. So thats why i say that alliens did not make that image or a landform human like image on mars. So thats what i was a scientist at NSAS discussing the face with someone who thinks it was alliens that formed a human like imagie on mars.\n",

            " The face you see that is shown yu may think it has something to do wit an alien but the face is just a natural landform , that has be there for many years , and prolly decades.It has been shown over the world .Many people have been on the face of mars like the Vikings in 1976 to take pictures for their sisters ships .And like on April 5,1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, the man Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter camera , and they team moc team took 10 picture better than than the original Viking pics .Got put on websites ,and then thats when people found out it wasnt no alien monument. Thats why it has nothing to do with aliens.Its just a natural landform. But people still believe that it was an Alien there because ,where the face is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 . A clouds time of the year on the red planet . so my people look in each 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters , compared it to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photos , to find out wat the pic actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa -lamdform common around the american west. The face on the mars is a landform not an alien monument after all .   \n",

            " Twenty five years ago a NASA Viking 1 aircraft was circling around Mars to find somewhere to land for its sister ship Viking 2. The aircraft was taking pictures and it captured something very unusual. It was a human face,it was enormous. It's head was two miles from each end to end. Once the word got out and NASA unveiled a picture it gave Mars lots of attention. Since it was on Mars lots of people thought that it was made by an alien. They is unbelieveable how can aliens make a human face. Aliens aren't even real so how can they make it. Plus, If they were real how would they be able to make a human face if they never seen one. I agree with the JPL website that it is indeed a natural landform. According to the passage it says that \" The image first appeared on a JPL website, revealling.... a natural landform\". There was no alien monument after all. Garvin says that \" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars\". I know that the face on mars was just a natual lanform. I know this because there is no such thing as aliens and there isn't any evidence to completely prove this. Plus I believe if there was alien they want no how humans look or theirselves for that matter. Scientist say that it is indeed a landform. I mean just think about it have u ever ate some potato chips and seen a chip that resembled something or someone. Would you sit there and think an alien did that or is it just natural , the way it is. I strongly believe that The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.\n",

Evidence from the text shows that when NASA first seen this picture that they thought nothing of it for the simple fact that it has been seen in areas in West America thats natural and so they thought it was a Martain mesa.

But i think the rock formation is just the way the land forms because i see weird formations of things all the time they're just thinking of it the wrong way i belive.I agree that land formats can be the most convincing because your never going to know what you'll see. However i think that this is just an must understandment of photos. NASA has to research and discover such a thing or land format i strongly believe that this is just the land formation the way the rock is shaped and structured. In the passege is says that landforms are common around the american west so the landfromation NASA said that they aliens made was actually land formations because were there most common its going to happen often.In paragraph 7 it states \"There was no alien mounment after all.\". In my Conclusion i'll present to you that after all the alien monument was actually land formations because there most commen in the west. It could be some alien's work but not quite yet is there time. The land formations can create some of the most beautiful work. I Strongly agree with NASA that there were no alien monument at all because why would an alien come to mars to build a giant face like sculpture just to get attiton on mars. Kinda funny right ? Okay so now do belive that mars does not have a face on it ? \n",

            "\n",
            "First of all, it's obvoiusly not a face because the newer pictures ,that were taken of the same thing show a different thing.You might wonder, how can it show a different thing but still be the same thing?Well, the newest picture,from 2001, was taken with a much better camera.So, the picture is clearer and so is the fact that this is a natural landform.Finally, the pictures are the most important clue that the face is a natural landform.That is how the pictures tell that the face is a landform.\n",
            "\n",
            "Secondly, if you compare landforms on Earth to the face pictures you'll get similar pictures.For example, if you take a picture of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho from above and compare it to the 2001 picture they'll look identical.That is according to cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.He stated that, the face reminds him the most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.Finally, when and if you get the chance you should compare the face to other landforms on Earth.That is how comparing landforms on Earth,to the face can provide evidence to you that the face is a natural landform.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, your brain somewhat tricks you into seeing a face,but don't worry because it's natural.When you look at the first picture, you're most likely going to see a face, even I see a face.So, we kind of get excited about discovering another life form, and we start to jump to conclusions.Don't think there is something wrong with that because there is not, as long as you have evidence to support it,but in this case,you don't.Furthermore, the reason are brain 'tricks' us into seeing a face is in our DNA.For example,from when you were born everytime you looked in the mirror or looked at somebody else, you saw a face.The reason why you always see a face is because our brain has been ''hard-wired'' to recognize a face.That is how our brains trick us into seeing a face.\n",

            "To conclude, those are all the clues/reasons why your brain sees and thinks the first picture is a face when it's actually a natural landform called a mesa.To recap, the comparison of the first picture to the 2001 picture can show that it's a mesa. Next, the comparison of landforms on Earth to the face can show you it's a mesa.Those are clues that can prove to you that the face is a mesa. So basically, all you have to do is compare different things to the face.Finally, the reason why your brain tricks you into seeing a face instead of a mesa is because everybody's brain has been 'hard-wired' to recognize a face.So that is why when you look at the first picture you see a face instead of what it really is, a mesa.Finally, sometimes all you have to do to find the truth is dig and look deeper and you'll discover the truth.That is why I say the face in the first picture is actually, indeed a mesa.\n",

Twenty five years ago something very odd happened around around Mars. We had one of our spacecrafts (Viking 1) circling mars, and taking pictures of possible landing sites for another one of our spacecrafts (Viking 2). Later on, we found that Viking 1 had snapped a picture of what seemed to look like a human face. We were very excited to find out what this new finding was, but we later found out that it was just a Martian mesa. Very common around Cydonia. Only this particular mesa had very outrageuos shadows, that made it look like a face.\n",

Like I was saying, I was in a coffe shop nearby where I worked, and was suddenly approached by a young man in his twenties. He stood there for a while making sure that I acknowledged him. When I did finally notice him, he smiled, and said that his name was Stan. He told me that he noticed my labcoat and where I worked, and wanted to bring up the topic \"The Face\".

Even when I said this, he disregarded it, and continued speaking about how he thought that this picture of \"the Mesa\" was proof of extraterestrial life on mars. as soon as he said this I burst out with laughter. Tears were falling from my eyes, as I thought this was a joke. but, when i saw that he was serious, I immediatley stopped laughing, and apologized. i explained to him that the picture of what he thought was a face, really was just \"the Martian equilavent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west\".

I stated that \"The Face on mars was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of the year on the red planet\". even after this was said he shook his head with a tiny smirk on his face.

            " I do not agree that the face on Mars was made by aliens for a couple of reasons. The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars Only samples that they can never find to be true. Another reason for my disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane. I also disagree because in paragragh seven when they flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5,1998 they said that there was no alien monument after all. From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues. The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a \"messa brutte\" which is a landform so that gives the answer right there.

            " In the passage, “Unmasking the Face on Mars”, you read of two different veiws on how the “Face” came to be. On one hand, there is the arguemnt that the “face” is proof of life on Mars.

After comparing the two, take a glance at the third picture taken in 2001. In the last picture you may see an even bigger difference than that of the first image. It is a very clear picture, regarding the knowledgeable observation that the face can be a part of land formed by a natural cause and which also has that of a shadow of a human face. Also, later explained in the passage in section 12, is of how simular the landform is to that of some here on Earth created by lava.\n",

Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" NASA would definetly share any evidence of alien life with the public because that would be great publicity for them.

As quoted from the passage \" ... when it spotted something with the shadowy likeness of a human face...\" \" ....' formed by the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.' \" This shows that the 'face' can only be seen with shadows.\n",

Also, if you really think aliens were trying to communicate with us humans, don't you think they'd use something a little bit more sophisticated other than making a human like face in the ground on Mars? Conspiracy theorists are just way out of line, this is only a geographal difference in the land that is on Mars, it isn't an Extra Terestrial phonominon, just a change in the land, it happens all the time. And if NASA would have just kept these images only for us to use, then we wouldn't have the problem of people making asumptions and jumping to conclusions that it's aliens. It seems to me that whenever something is found anywhere in space, it's always acounted to aliens, there's no proof of them, but there is proof on the other way around. Just like i said, this only has to do with the geography on Mars, not aliens. My point, exactly. Plus there is literal proof that explains that this was not an alien monument, in fact it was a natural landform instead.\n",

            " 25 years ago, there was an abnormal structure discovered by NASA's Viking 1 Space Shuttle as it was circling Mars to find possible landing sites for it's siter ship Viking 2 when it spotted the abnormal structure. This abnormal sturcture was called the \"Face on Mars\" that stretched out two miles from end to end located in Cydonia. Shortly after it was found, scientists figured it was just another Martian Mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n",

As the pictures were reveiled on the JPL web site \"the Face on Mars\" was just a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all. On April 8, 2001, Mallin's team captured a photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoltuion, each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best Viking 1 photo in 1976. \"If there was an object in this photograph like planes on the ground of Eygptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\", said Garvin.\n",

            " Whether you are someone who believes conspiracy theories, or are just plain stupid and think that somehow the Face is evidence of alien life, you are still wrong. It's just a rock, a plain, thousands of years old, heap of rock. The End, no \"Ifs, ands, or buts\", there is evidence saying that this is just a mesa, a landform, we have picture proof of it. However, considering that I must write this for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, I still have to argue about it pointlessly with an imaginary person who might or might not exist. So, I will cover two major points to prove to you that it's a landform, common sense, and the facts that we here at NASA have proven to be true.\n",
            "\n",
            "First off, this argument is over whether Face was created by aliens, or whether it is just a natural landform. This is a pretty strange argumental topic, as people who believe this stuff anyway will hardly be convinced by a random scientist at NASA. Anyway, there is proof we have that face is just a natural landform, we have taken multiple pictues of it, and have concluded that, as shown with this cite of evidence, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the America West.\" We can even say that it was not obscured by any clouds or haze because it was clear day on Mars the day the picture was taken. That should be the end of the discussion, but yet you say, \"But Mister science man, what if the pictures that you took couldn't see it because it was too small?\" Well, that point can actually be rebuted as well, because of what Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixer size,\" he added. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\". Factually that should be the end of it, it was a clear picture, that was enhanced for farther detail, on a clear day, with a high resolution camera.\n",
            "\n",
            "Don't think I don't see you thinking, \"But will a only a photo actually be able to properly discern whether this is natural.\" Well......no, it won't. Actually, you have me entirely beat on the fact that it simply could be a landform, made by aliens. Yes, there I admit it, sit at home and laugh at the fact that I could be wrong. Look, Mister Whoever reads this for a job, I argue for a living with my friend, and there is simply not enough evidence to actually say that there is no way that this is not alien made. There is actually a chance, somewhere, somehow, a superficially small chance that aliens might have had someplay in this. I know that all sounds crazy, but seriously, think about it. All we have is some lously picture that, while it shows us the exteriror, it doesn't show us anything about the interior of the landform.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here is the other side to the point I just made, think about this rationally for a second, could aliens really have made a monument or some strange thing on Mars, only for it to be found by humans? Probably not, and all of this is so improbable that I really don't even need to write an argumentative essay about it anyway. There is an extremely small and slim chance that aliens had any part in making a mesa on Mars.\n",

What this is saying is that there is no proof that aliens made this and that there are proof that aliens did all of this but there is proof that it is just landform that they came across that turned out to be a face said in paragraph 8 it says \"We dont just pass over the face very often,\" he noted. There several facts saying that this is just a landform other people disagree that this is infact made by aliens but when it all comes down this is just another theory saying that aliens are real and that is proof but what they dont know is that this is just another landform in the shape of something that turns out to be a face.

People had to have curiosity, and the willpower to go on with these expeditions. After they disproved a theory, it made more sense, and the world around us just is.

We have no facts to prove that it WAS made by aliens, furthermore there being a whole civilization of aliens living on mars. There are many landforms as this one on Mars, and even on Earth, that happen to show some type of face, or object that would rather look man-made or even \"alien\" made. Just because there is a landform that has a shape, and look of a face, doesn't neccessarily mean that there is a life-form living on Mars. For there to be some type of life-for on Mars, yes, it would most benefit NASA, by finding out what is that life-form, how its living, and so on.

            " I see that you believe that the Face could mean that there are or were a sort of life form on Mars. This is easy to belive at first glance, but we decided to look further. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over this red planet. The MOC team took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed a natural landform.

Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This means that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.

            " Many people think that the face are created by aliens. Myself thinking i dont think aliens are real. This face from Mars in 1976 is natural form from Earth. We're still researching on the real idea of what is may have came from in the pass years. Also, many says it may be a reflected or shadow from something. Other scientist conclude that it may be just rocks in a hug formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows or dust giving illusion of eyes, nose ,and mouth. They called it \"The Face on Mars.\" Most of the commuication of it started in a Hollywood film. Appeared in books ,magazines, radio talk shows , even hauted grocery store checkoutlines for 25 years. I think theres just a rock with holes in the it , looking like a human face but no one will never know til someone takes the trip to find out. By many think it was aliens creating it, people just assummed that idea. Other scientist still today wonder what it really is or how was it really created. There may have been a ancient civilization on Mars years ago. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for research to post a better and good viewer of the Face on Mars. Im thinking , by revealing alot of research, taking pictures and not approving that the face isnt changed by the amount of days and years, that it may just be a natural landform and that theres no aliens monument after all. There will still be other thinking and having their own opinions about the Face on Mars. Everyone wont just be satisfied with one fact or option about the face. Still many and most scientist are till snapping camera shots of the face and posting them on the web. More and more people and scientist will have diiferent thoughts about it and the world will never know what is going and what is it really until someone actually observed face to face. In my opinion, I think by wasting time doing research on something so little that have been lasting for years, no one never had the time to really go observe the reality about the face. Doing this research and conclude things will never tell the people answers about what the face. \n",

The picture they got showed a natural landform, not an Alien monument after all. Even after the picture in 1998, not everyone was satisfied because the camera on board the Mars Global Surveyor had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. So skeptics said perhaps alien markings were hidden by the haze. So on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.

The actual quote is, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Eygptian Pharaoh.\" A few days after the discovery, NASA released the image to the public along with this statement: \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"\n",

If it was an Egyptian Pharaoh the Egyptians would have had to have access to a type of modern tecology to get up to Mars. Not only that but they wouldn't know how to store or make food last in space. The journey up to Mars is a long one. “So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!” If we had saw these type of things then maybe we would need to look further into it, however we didn't so we have no proof that they lived on Mars long enough to build this \"special mound\" or \"Egyptian Pharaoh \". What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa—landforms common around the American West. “It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" People have seen these similar mounds on Earth, However this particualr mound on Mars had some unsual shadowing to it and the picture was taken on a cloudy day making it hard to make out what this could have been. \" But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April ’98—a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\"Then when we had a clear summer day we took another one with better techology, finally revealing it in fact was not a Egyptian Pharaoh just a mound of dirt though some remain spectiable of this \"face\" and how it got there.\n",

The reason why I say this is because NASA has no proof besides what they think is a face created by aliens on Mars. I have watched many shows about space and other shows like Brian Games. Brian Games had a show about faces, and it said that you can see an object and make it look human or make it look like a face, such as a specific flower that might look like a face. This is what those scientists are doing in this very situation. They are mistaking a natural made land form on Mars as an alien build face. There are many ways this landform could have been made. It could have been made by wind and rocks blowing across what you could say is a landscape. As you can see from the landform is that it has faided away over time and now looks like a lump of sand, which wouldn't you think if aliens made that they would fix it up and make it look like a face again?

They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution.

There was no alien monument after all.\" This shows that the Face was just one or a couple of years, but it went away and is now shown as a flat rock surface. Another way you know that it is a natural landform is because in the article it says that when the original NASA picture was taken they captioned it saying that it was a rock formation. In the article it says, \"NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face....A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head'.\" This explains that even though the people at NASA also thought that it looked like a face they still said that it was just a rock formation that happened to look like a human face.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are many more reason to believe that the Face is a natural landform and there are really no reasons why someone should believe that the Face is still on Mars, but we aren't getting good enough pictures. In the article it mentions a lot that the Face on Mar is just a landform and that even though people have come to believe that it was an alien they really should believe that it is a landform because there are so many more reasons to belive that.\n",

I have to agree, and say that the Face is a natural landform. Reasons to back up my thought would include, that the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped quite a few pictures showing that it wasn't a real face, they have never seen anything like this before, and more scientists believed it was a rock formation rather than an alien.\n",

Scientists also haven't seen anything like this before. In paragraph 9 it mentioned, \"We just dont pass over the Face very often.\" If it really was an alien you would see more things like this because there wouldn't be just one alien, there would way more, causing there to be more faces. More scientists also believed that the Face was a natural landform, while only a few believed it could have been an alien feature. Within paragraph 8 it stated, \"But not everyone was satisfied...

            " The face on Mars wasn't created by aliens, in fact it has no connection to alien life form at all! When the face was first discovered no one had really known much about it so people started hopping to conclusions before anything could be proven or tested. That is until NASA started looking into this \"face on Mars\". The face is actually a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. That's it- simply a rock formation but the shadows casted upon the crevices gives the strange formation the appeal of a human face. When people began to become even more skepical, on April 8, 2001, NASA had the Mars Global Surveyor draw close enough to snap another picture of the face. The day was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. NASA's serveyor camera had taken a crisp photo of the face in highest resolution. \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel.\" so you can discern things in a digital images three times better than the pixel size. So NASA, and the rest of the world, had a more clear and better picture of the face everyone was talking about. Although the face may seem strange, it could be a rather common landform for Cydonia. \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West.\" Although this one may seem to stick out from the rest, it could merely be the shadows playing tricks on the human mind. \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" The landform may very well be common around Mars, it's merely the shadows ghosting around the landform that causes it to look like a face! So in reality, there is no alien life form connected to this rock formation at all! \n",

I must say that the first picture in 1976 looks a lot like an alien, but we have gotten better technology and the newest pictures show it is just a monument. It resembles the butte or mesa landforms in the American West. They are naturally formed in nature. As my colleague said in his text they resemble eachother enormously. Also, we used the absolute maximum resolution in the latest picture we took in 2001. It was made very apparent that this was not aliens at work but again just a natural landform. The only reason that people aren't believing the truth with our technology is because these conspiracy theorists. Finally, the biggest piece of evidence that the face is a natural landform is that if NASA discovered this, we would benefit tremendously. We are not hiding this from anyone. We here at NASA would get more money, funding, and attention. We mainly would want the funding to perhaps interact with the aliens if they were there, but they are not.

            " The face on Mars is a very interesting thing. It looks like a human head but there is now way it could be because it is two miles long. Some people say that is was made by aliens. NASA says that it is just a rock formation that happend naturaly. There are many arguments for both sides. I'm going to tell you the arguments from the side that says it is just a natural rock formation. This face on Mars is a natural rock formation because, if it were made by aliens than when they got close to it they would have saw things that would be unatural. Another reason is it looks like buttes and mesas that we have here in the United States. Lastly we have been studying this for twenty five years and never before has an alien came up and said, \"Hi I made this\".\n",
            "\n",
            "The first reason why I thin that this was a natural formation is that we have gotten realy close to the formation and never have we seen any aliens or even any buildings other than the face. On April 8,2001 it was a cloudless summer dday in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, said Garvin. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This proves how close they got to the planet and they never had anything happen to the nor did they see anything. Thust proving my first point.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another reason this formation is natural is that there are formation in the United States that have naturlay occured. Buttes and mesas look very similar to the face on Mars. This is what NASA says about it ,what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. This shows that there are very simmilar things to the face in our world today.

So,it shows that it was not created millions of year's ago by some extra-terrestrial bieng(s).Also,when the Viking 1 Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) took the photo in 1976 it looked as if it was just a common landform created by some-type of desert storm,and now that other photos have came in from May 24,2001 from Viking 2 we are shown that it is not a face but a few mesa's(mesa-landforms common around the American west) with shadows on it showing features of a human bieng but are really just hills of sand with weirdly shaped landforms and shadows. Also,on many planets we have seen craters,mountain,and canyons that look like something they're not,and when the shadows are not there you can tell that they are just naturally formed sand hills. Finally,In 1998 the Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) took 10 photos much sharper photos(5 times sharper)than the original Viking 1 did in 1976 and the photos on the (MOC) showed and revealed to be that there was no alien monument or alien worshipping monument just natural landforms.\n",

To further examine, on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cyondia, the area where the rock formation is found, and Michael Malin took a picture that was ten times sharper than before. The image was released and revealed to be a natural landform. However, on that day the camera had to look through thin clouds to capture the picture, so come skeptics were content with the theory that some of the alien markings could of been hidden. A cloudless day came on April 8, 2001, so the Mars Global Surveyor took the chance to get another look. The camera's maximum resolution was used to capture the photo. Since the photo was closely zoomed in, it would of been possible to see what was on the ground near by. Since nothing was found on the ground nearby, it doesn't support the conspiracy theorists who claimed that NASA was trying to hide alien life. The picture shows that it is like a mesa or butte, a landform that can be commonly found in West America. To further help people understand, Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mar's Exploration Program, describes the land form as \"It reminds me of most Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain Idaho.That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" There very well could still be life on Mars, but unfortunately it has not been found with this information.\n",

My second reason is that if there was any chance that there was life on Mars NASA would keep it to themselves.

            " In recent years the scientists of NASA have done research and even taken pictures of Mars. In the year 1976 we released a photo of Mars taken by the Viking showing a face like figure on this planet. Yet I say that it is not an alien artifact it is a regular landform like those on Earth. The face in the photo is made from shadows, and photos taken more recently show a\n",

            "\n",
            "First of all, the face in \"The Face of Mars\" is a play on lighting. It is an optical illusion made by shadows and the shape of the landform. This is a mere trick of the eye that happend to appear on our camera in 1976. We released this because we thought it would spark interest in Mars from the public. It did peak people's interest because it went around for 25 years. Yet none of us [scientists] believed it to be an artifact or a piece of evidence for life.\n",
            "\n",
            "Furthermore, the picture from 1998, taken by the Mars Global Surveyor, shows no resemblance to a face at all. This was taken on a higher resolution, and it was ten times sharper than the first. We released this picture on a JPL web site so the people could view the pictures. It only proved that this was a mesa or butte.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, we went back to Mars in 2001 to get one last picture. We got the picture on a clear summer day for Mars; there was not a cloud in the sky. Then the pictures had a span of 1.56 meters per pixel; this was the camera's maximum resolution. We had pulled all the stops to get the best picture we could this time. As it is known, in digital images things can be discerned three times bigger than the pixel size. This means that if there were to be any objects in the pictures we would be able to see what it was. Again in the pictures nothing unusual or face-like showed up. It was just a natural landform, like on Earth. Jim Garvin, a scientist that has been there with these pictures and helped with Mars research has descirbed \"The Face of Mars\". \"It reminds me most of MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" he said. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n",

            "In conclusion, this evidence shows that \"The Face of Mars\" is just a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The photographs taken later have sharper resolution, were taken with accuracy, and these pictures revealed it was nothing but a landform. The face that is in the first photo from the Viking is an optical illusion made by shadows and lighting. Even other professional scientists say that this is not an artifact of ancient civilization but a landform. Therefore, \"The Face of Mars\"\n",

They believe the haze would cover up any signs of Martian markings or life. However the place where the \"Face on Mars\" resides, Cydonia, is rarely targeted by the Mars Global Surveyor.

When using the Mars Global Survey spacecraft it´s high resolution camera picked up no signs of any type of advanced civilization.

Also in paragraph twelve it states that on Earth these landforms are most common in the American west. These particular formations are especially common in the Cydonia region of Mars. Finding these landforms in this region are so common that the scientists at NASA were shocked at how much it resembled a face, knowing it was not an alien artifact. Another reason that we know it is a butte is because it was not only photographed once or twice but three times!\n",

            "This landform has been photographed by two different spacecraft, the Viking 1 and the Mars Global Surveyor. These spacecraft were spread apart for a span of over 25 years! The Viking 1 picked up the best images it could for it´s time but the much more recent Mars Global Surveyor has a much better and more accurate image of the ¨Face¨ than the 1976 photo. The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) also took two clear photographs of the landform while the 1976 image is blurry to say the least. In 1976 the image was so fuzzy that no one could tell what was there, which led to reporters and authors to excite the public more than what was necessary.\n",

Authors did this to draw more attention to Mars, which because NASA serves the interests of the people and the government was an outstanding thing but it went to far. After all a face on a planet not all that far from us makes a great headline. Not everyone exaggerated it though NASA, as said in the article, upon releasing the pictures to the public stated ¨huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.¨ The face on Mars was also used in afilm and in countless magazines across the country.\n",

So far no evidence supports the claims of conspiracy theorists, however that doen´t mean they never will. The ¨Face¨ on Mars has had many stories told about for over two and a half decades, and they are not going to stop anytime soon, but it is important to know that science has not proven anything about the ¨Face¨ on Mars, yet.    \n",

            " I know you may think that the face was made by aliens, but it isn't. How I know? Well in the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" NASA lists a whole bunch of reasons against this alien conspiracy. Number one, it is probably just another Martian mesa, which are common around Cydonia. Number two, it looks like a regular landform due to comparisons to Earths landforms. Lastly, number three, sometimes the face isn't even there due to its missing shadows. Conspirators would probably think that NASA would hide evidence of alien acts but NASA is so confident that this is not aliens that they showed the face to the public. You're probably thinking: Why should I believe you? Do you have evidence? As in fact I do.\n",

Scientists have proven that there are a lot of mesa's around Cydonia, a region on Mars where the face is located. \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" In this quote from the text it reveals how the face, if it is just a Martian mesa, is actually rather common on Cydonia. In that quote it also reveals that the face only has \"unusual shadows\" that give the face an effect of looking like an \"Egyptian Pharaoh\".\n",

            " Ther are 3 main supportive reassons why this \"face on mars\" is just a natral landform. One, there is a posibility that the face is just a \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth\"-paragraph 3.

I believe this beacuse NASA does not come across it veary often. Therefore, every time NASA did see the face then they might of just cought the rock formation at the right time, therefore cetching the right light. In a better picture taken in 1976 by Viking 1 you can clearly see shadows wich might be the scource of the face formation.\n",

            " If I was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, because in the story it's saids that '' Face on Mars'' has since became a pop icon. If I was a scientist in NASA I would found out how did the peron face came to another planet. They have to get out the earth to come to another planet to just put your face on it out of no were. But if a person did put there face inprint on a another planet, I think they will turn into a alien. I will tell you why I said that, because people say that aliens are real and they harm creatures. Also, if I'm the scientist this will tells that a FACE on a human body doing on a another planet they should be on earth. In the article it saids: twenty five years ago something funny happening around Mars, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for it's sister ship Viking 2. Also, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on the monitors. But now scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common enough around Cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. But if I'm the scientist trying to figured out all this work,and see who's the human face or a alien face because humans on earth an aliens in Mars or more planets. But afterwards after that happening, it saids how some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. Also, although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a prioprity for NASA when Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September. 1997, eighteen long years ago after the Viking missions ended.\n",

If he tried to use my evidence against me i would show him the picture and let him take a good look and tell him what it actually is and that its not alien related. After he wants to know how i discoverd that it wasnt real i would show him this article and state that this article it 100% acuarate and alien life isnt on that planet other wise the Viking 1 would have seen it when circleing it and scouting it. When i have completed my statement i would give him the cordanites to the planet so he can look at it from a satillite. When i tell him that the pictures taken in 1976 and 1998 were taken when there was bad weather on the planet he will understand why it looks identical to a human face and that alien life did not create this and he will agree and simply pass on the evidence of my statement to others who think that its a alien created object. \n",

            " It has come to my attention that there is a concern with conspiracy theorists about the Face on Mars. It has been said by these theorists that the Face on Mars is in fact, an alien monument. Clearly, the Face on Mars is no such thing, it is simply a landform. There is evicence from NASA supporting this statement, along with the landmark containg nothing else, and that there is no absolute proof that aliens even exist.\n",
            "\n",
            "Initially, when the first photo of the Face was taken by a Mars Global surveyor named Viking 1 in 1976, scientists were shocked and the public got excited about the idea of aliens on Mars. The passage claims,\"Scientists figured it was just another Marian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" This illustrates how the Face was at first mistaken as a landmark left by extraterrestrials, but was shortly discovered later as a mesa. Opponents might claim that NASA is hiding information supporting the statements of aliens making the Face. This is a red herring. If anything, NASA would benefit from the findings of evidence of lifeforms on Mars. It is also important to know that Jim Garver, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated,\"We felt this was important to taxpayers...-We photgraphed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" This shows how eager he was to show it to the public.\n",

Over the years the face changes it starts to change shape or crust over and because of that it makes it look like a natural landform. NASA wouldn't have sent it out if they really thought is was alien. Some people think that the face is a bona fide for evidence that there is life on mars, but NASA would hide that information. they only sent the image out to get more peoples attention towards mars.

So it is just a land formation, from where meterites have struck it from be hind and it kept posting out more and more. Over time just like it showes in the picture in 1976 it was juat stearthing out and in. 1998 you saw more it was not until March 24,2001, that it began to look like a face ,but in 2001 we were able to dipic the picture, and then see it was a face inside it.

            " Imagine you are a scientist at NASA sicussing the face withsomeone who thinks it was created by alliens. Well we all know that alliens are not real it has been provin many time by other scients. I would unerstand why people would think it was created by these myth cretures, but u also got to think about how land andother things can form tier self in to living fetures like for some exsample. On an sunny day you look outside and u see some clouds and you stare at it for a while. Than all the sudden u see faceses and animals that you reconginize. Like one day I saw a little dolphine in the sky and I got the thinking theirs no wasy their could be a dolphine in the sky. So thats like me saying that thiers a man shaped face on mars tat could have been civilisation on the planet of mars, but dont think wrong i believe that its possabel for people on earth to actual live on that, because theirs other scientists that has proven that to most people and their starting to recrute peopole to actual go to mars. Also their for in the passage it saids it was a huge rock formation like come on now we know a real life humae face is not as huge for it to be spotted from face. Also on mars their is a lot of diffrent shape and sizes and holes like in the moon so its just do univers doing what it does best to form diffrent imagies and diffrent shapes like the was it formed earth and broke diffrent things apart and also land. If u also look in the passage at paragraph 12 it saids in the first sentence that. What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa----LANDFORMS common around the american west. to also make people intrested in the artical the put a. Huge rock formation from mars so theri for their also saying it was made from these mythical cretures called. Alliens and why would alliens want to make a human face in the first pllace if you think about it it actually make sense. For them just to attract people to a new land form that they have found that has a more like humans fetures. So thats why i say that alliens did not make that image or a landform human like image on mars. So thats what i was a scientist at NSAS discussing the face with someone who thinks it was alliens that formed a human like imagie on mars.\n",

Thats why it has nothing to do with aliens.Its just a natural landform. But people still believe that it was an Alien there because ,where the face is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 . A clouds time of the year on the red planet . so my people look in each 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters , compared it to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photos , to find out wat the pic actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa -lamdform common around the american west.

In 1998 the picture could have been altered due to fog, but in 2001 a clear picture proved that the \"face\" on the mesa was just nothing to be excited about. Also if it was some sort of landmark of an ancient civilization you probably could have seen houses or shacks somewhere near it.

After reading the promt and looking at the pictures it is just a mound of dirt with some divites in it. As you can probably tell looking at the picture from 2001 to the newest picture, the photograph from 01 just looks like a mound of dirt with some holes in it, but the new picture has been badly photoshopped into looking like someone has just died and their face remains uncovered by dirt.

            "The first picture was taken from the Viking 1 in the year 1976. The photograph isnt very clear which will give you an advantage to pursuade other people that it is an alien artifact. But through out the years the space shuttle Viking 1, has taken a few more pictures. A Viking 1 photo from 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) image from 1998, and the latest MGS image from 2001. Thanks to new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa. Also on April, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times more sharper than the original Viking photos! Whe revealed the picture on a JPL web site just to reveal a natural landform. There wasn't any alien monument after all my dear friend. You may say that even on April 8, 2001 MGS drew close enough for a look on the \"face\". Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. What the picture actuall really showed was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landroms common around the American West. The mesa in Mars even reminded Garvin of the Middle Butte in the Snake river Plain of Idaho!\"\n",

If there were aliens and they put the face there, dont you think they would've came to earth already, Mars atmosphere is too strong for an so called alien or human to be on there, and also the face just could be a natural landform made from weather changes.

After he wants to know how i discoverd that it wasnt real i would show him this article and state that this article it 100% acuarate and alien life isnt on that planet other wise the Viking 1 would have seen it when circleing it and scouting it. When i have completed my statement i would give him the cordanites to the planet so he can look at it from a satillite. When i tell him that the pictures taken in 1976 and 1998 were taken when there was bad weather on the planet he will understand why it looks identical to a human face and that alien life did not create this and he will agree and simply pass on the evidence of my statement to others who think that its a alien created object. \n",

            " It has come to my attention that there is a concern with conspiracy theorists about the Face on Mars. It has been said by these theorists that the Face on Mars is in fact, an alien monument. Clearly, the Face on Mars is no such thing, it is simply a landform. There is evicence from NASA supporting this statement, along with the landmark containg nothing else, and that there is no absolute proof that aliens even exist.\n",
            "\n",
            "Initially, when the first photo of the Face was taken by a Mars Global surveyor named Viking 1 in 1976, scientists were shocked and the public got excited about the idea of aliens on Mars. The passage claims,\"Scientists figured it was just another Marian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" This illustrates how the Face was at first mistaken as a landmark left by extraterrestrials, but was shortly discovered later as a mesa. Opponents might claim that NASA is hiding information supporting the statements of aliens making the Face. This is a red herring. If anything, NASA would benefit from the findings of evidence of lifeforms on Mars. It is also important to know that Jim Garver, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated,\"We felt this was important to taxpayers...-We photgraphed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" This shows how eager he was to show it to the public.\n",

We have made a resent break through on if it was or was not, and truns out it was not it was just a land formation. See there are a lot of stuff that can be formed from earth that was formed by God like the Grand Canyon, or Mount Everus. So it is just a land formation, from where meterites have struck it from be hind and it kept posting out more and more. Over time just like it showes in the picture in 1976 it was juat stearthing out and in. 1998 you saw more it was not until March 24,2001, that it began to look like a face ,but in 2001 we were able to dipic the picture, and then see it was a face inside it.

            " welll aliens arent real and honestly its kinda proven that aliens arent real if it was me i would sit down with the person and i would talk and tell them that it isnt true meaning \"aliens\" arent real and if they wanna argue about it i would make them sit and research it all and then have them bring me a writen report tellin me everything. even though what they are saying in the passage is \"true\" \"to them\" they still havent provin it so therefore they arent real they are just convinsing there selfs it is true and it isnt... all they saw was shawdows. shawdows dont tell you anything they said in one part that helps me show that they arent real is they said they look like humans the only thing that can be looking like a human is a human, its simple and pretty straight forward they face on mars just looks like a normal face over the year it would have added on and changed like it would have messed up by now cause its kinda like sand m point is it cant be a alien cause it would have changed and showed over the years we wouldve been able to discover and prove that aliens are real but we havent so therefore they arent real. as of what the passage says \" what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the american west. it reminds me most of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho says garvin thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars\". therefore provesthat the face on mars is not from/or a alien. but once again if it was an arguement between someone that believes and doesnt i would make them try to prove that rhey are real just to see if they can.   \n",

            " Imagine you are a scientist at NASA sicussing the face withsomeone who thinks it was created by alliens. Well we all know that alliens are not real it has been provin many time by other scients. I would unerstand why people would think it was created by these myth cretures, but u also got to think about how land andother things can form tier self in to living fetures like for some exsample. On an sunny day you look outside and u see some clouds and you stare at it for a while. Than all the sudden u see faceses and animals that you reconginize. Like one day I saw a little dolphine in the sky and I got the thinking theirs no wasy their could be a dolphine in the sky. So thats like me saying that thiers a man shaped face on mars tat could have been civilisation on the planet of mars, but dont think wrong i believe that its possabel for people on earth to actual live on that, because theirs other scientists that has proven that to most people and their starting to recrute peopole to actual go to mars. Also their for in the passage it saids it was a huge rock formation like come on now we know a real life humae face is not as huge for it to be spotted from face. Also on mars their is a lot of diffrent shape and sizes and holes like in the moon so its just do univers doing what it does best to form diffrent imagies and diffrent shapes like the was it formed earth and broke diffrent things apart and also land. If u also look in the passage at paragraph 12 it saids in the first sentence that. What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa----LANDFORMS common around the american west. to also make people intrested in the artical the put a. Huge rock formation from mars so theri for their also saying it was made from these mythical cretures called. Alliens and why would alliens want to make a human face in the first pllace if you think about it it actually make sense. For them just to attract people to a new land form that they have found that has a more like humans fetures. So thats why i say that alliens did not make that image or a landform human like image on mars. So thats what i was a scientist at NSAS discussing the face with someone who thinks it was alliens that formed a human like imagie on mars.\n",

            " The face you see that is shown yu may think it has something to do wit an alien but the face is just a natural landform , that has be there for many years , and prolly decades.It has been shown over the world .Many people have been on the face of mars like the Vikings in 1976 to take pictures for their sisters ships .And like on April 5,1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, the man Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter camera , and they team moc team took 10 picture better than than the original Viking pics .Got put on websites ,and then thats when people found out it wasnt no alien monument. Thats why it has nothing to do with aliens.Its just a natural landform. But people still believe that it was an Alien there because ,where the face is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 . A clouds time of the year on the red planet . so my people look in each 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters , compared it to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photos , to find out wat the pic actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa -lamdform common around the american west.

On April 5, 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture that was ten times more sharper than the original Viking photos. That picture instead of revealing a Martian civilization it instead revealed a mesa with indentations and outcroppings of land. Then again on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, April 8, 2001, they took another photo. This time the photo used \"the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" And again all it revealed was a simple mesa with little lumps and marks. It didn't even resemble a face at all. These photos proved that there are no aliens, just alot of oddly shaped mesas.\n",

But through out the years the space shuttle Viking 1, has taken a few more pictures. A Viking 1 photo from 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) image from 1998, and the latest MGS image from 2001. Thanks to new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa. Also on April, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times more sharper than the original Viking photos! Whe revealed the picture on a JPL web site just to reveal a natural landform. There wasn't any alien monument after all my dear friend. You may say that even on April 8, 2001 MGS drew close enough for a look on the \"face\". Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. What the picture actuall really showed was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landroms common around the American West.

After that comment this person had me thinking, I didn't believe what he said was true. After I considered it I had a long talk with this young man, here were my arguments. If there were aliens and they put the face there, dont you think they would've came to earth already, Mars atmosphere is too strong for an so called alien or human to be on there, and also the face just could be a natural landform made from weather changes.
